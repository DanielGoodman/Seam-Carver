# Project Title

This is my attempt at creating a seam carving algorithm. This program will allows users to shrink their photos while getting rid of the 
least important pixels. Currently only vertical seam removal is supported.

## Version

Current version: 0.9
	- User inputs file path and desired output path
	- User inputs desired number of horizontal pixel reduction (how many pixels to shorten picture width by)
	
Future features:
	- Horizontal seam carving
	- Forward energy
	
## Credits

Idea for this project was obtained from Princton class cos226, Programming Assignment 7.
